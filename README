minSort.h       Declaration for minSort
bubbleSort.c    Code provided by Darrell Long, it has the method for bubbleSort method
bubbleSort.h    Declaration for bubbleSort
insertionSort.c The psuedo code was given by Long. It does insertionSort
insertionSort.h Declares insertionSort methods
quickSort.c     quicksort is one of the fastest sorting method. I got help from YouTube
quickSort.h     declares quickSort
mergeSort.c     See the cite inside mergeSort.c, this is also one of the fastest way of sorting
mergeSort.h     declares methods for mergeSort

sorting.c       The main function is located here, as well as many important methods at the end of the file
sorting.h       Declares the methods
README          Instructions
Makefile        To compile the program

What does this program do?
You can sort numbers with this method, and see the comparison between different sorting method.

How do I use it?
type 'make' or 'make all' to compile the program. Type make clean to remove the objects and program files

ex-  ./sorting -q       will sort numbers using quickSort

All the flags
From the pdf
-A means employ all sorting algorithms. • -m means enable minSort.
-b means enable bubbleSort.
-i means enable insertionSort.
-q means enable quickSort.
-M means enable mergeSort.
-p n means print the first n elements of the array. The default value is 100. • -r s means set the random seed to s. The default is 8222022.
-n c means set the array size to c. The default value is 100.
